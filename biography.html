<p>Aryabhata, also called Aryabhata I or Aryabhata the Elder, was the first
mathematician and astronomer of India. He had acquired vast knowledge in the
field of mathematics. He also discovered several things for which Indians feel
proud of even now. His renowned discoveries were algebraic identities, trigonometric
functions, the value of pi, and the place value system, etc. Aryabhatta
wrote many famous books which are treated as Bible in Mathematics. Many
youngsters were inspired by Aryabhatta in the field of mathematics. His contribution
to society is highly acclaimed to date.</p>
<p>Aryabhata was born in 475 A.D. in an unknown place. But according to his
book ‘Aryabhatiya’, he lived in Kusumpura, the modern-day Patna. The archaeologists
hold this belief till today that he continued his studies in Kusumpura.
The reason behind the beliefs is his significant works of astronomy were found
in Kusumpura.
Therefore, it can be believed that Aryabhatta spent most of his life in this
place. Besides this, it is believed by some historians that he was the head of
the Nalanda University in Kusumpura. All of the aforementioned theories are
based on guesses and hypotheses because no proper evidence is there except the
books written by Aryabhatta. Some of the records were lost and are not found
until now.</p>
<p>Aryabhata died a successful mathematician, astronomer and scientist at the age of 74. The place and time of death are still unknown. It was believed he spent most of his life in Kusumapura, Pataliputra.</p>
