    <center><h1> <font size="+2"> Aryabata's Contribution</font></h1></center>

    <p>Some of Aryabhata's contribution to Mathematics are: <ul><li>
Approximation of π</li>
<li>Concept of Zero and Place Value System</li>
<li>Cube roots and Square roots</li>
<li>Trigonometry</li>
<li>Aryabhata’s Identities</li>
<li> Indeterminate or Diophantine’s Equations</li>
<li>Area of Triangle</li></ul></p>
<p>There are also many astronomical theories written in the book ‘Aryabhatiya’.
Aryabhatta was not only efficient in Mathematics but he also had immense
knowledge of astronomy. According to his heliocentric theory, planets revolve
around the sun. He calculated the speed of the various planets concerning the
Sun with the help of his theory. The sidereal rotation was also calculated by
him. One of his major discoveries in the field of astronomy was the sidereal year
which states that it should be 365 days, 6 hours, 12 minutes, and 30 seconds
in a year. This deviates from the present-day value by only 3 minutes and 20
seconds.
It was Aryabhatta who correctly discovered the fact that the earth rotates on
its axis. He also anticipated the geocentric model of the solar system which said
the earth to be the centre of the universe. The sun, the moon, and the planets
rotate around it. Solar and lunar eclipses were also described in his book. The
fact that solar eclipse and lunar eclipse take place due to the shadow-casting of
the earth and the moon was explained in his book.
It can be said that the approximations made by Aryabhatta in the field of
astronomy were very much accurate. The core of the computational paradigm
is generated by the theories of Aryabhatta. As Indian citizens, we should feel
proud of Aryabhatta because he had invented such things which can’t be imagined
in the present day without the facilities of modern equipment.</p>
