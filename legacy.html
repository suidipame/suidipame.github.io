<center><h1> <font size="+2">Aryabhata's Legacy</font></h1></center>

<p>Indian astronomical traditions and other cultures were highly influenced by
Aryabhata’s work. His works, experiments and calculations were translated into
several languages to help other astronomers. During the Islamic Golden Age,
the Arabian translation was specifically influential. Some of his results were
cited by great Arabian mathematicians such as Al-Biruni and Al-Khawarizmi
who believed that the Earth rotates on its axis.</p>
<p>Aryabhata’s definitions for cosine, sine, inverse sine, verse sine gave birth to
Trigonometry. He was one of the first mathematicians to determine sine and
versine (1-cosx) tables from 0 to 90 degrees in the interval of 3.75 degrees to an
accuracy of 4 decimal places.</p>
<p>The modern names of Trigonometric functions, sine and cosine are derived
from the Sanskrit words “jya” and “Kojya” which were introduced by him.
His astronomical calculation techniques were also very popular among different
astronomers. They were widely used to form Arabic astronomical tables
“zijes”.
<p>Along with this, his calendrical calculations have been used in India to form
the Hindu calendar “Panchgram”. This calendar formed the basis of the Islamic
calendar “Jalali” which was introduced by a group of Islamic astronomers in
1073 CE. The modified versions of this calendar are still in use in Afghanistan
and Iran.</p>
<p>To honour Aryabhata for his works, the Bihar Government has established
Aryabhatta Knowledge University to promote astronomical knowledge among
interested students. As well as the first Indian satellite was also named after
him.
